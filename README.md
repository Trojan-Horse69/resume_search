# Resume Search Chatbot (MVP)
This project demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to efficiently index and search resumes, offering an improved alternative to traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). By using AI-driven similarity search, the chatbot provides recruiters and hiring managers with the top resumes that best meet their needs.

Currently, the chatbot performs similarity searches to retrieve the best resumes based on the user's query. More features will be added in the future to enhance its capabilities.
